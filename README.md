# BackGround

This project is focused on writing a scheme in Haskell. It follows the [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours Tutorial](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours). If you don't know haskell and want to get some initial skills to follow it right, check out this [10 minutes tutorial](https://wiki.haskell.org/Learn_Haskell_in_10_minutes).

# What is a Scheme?

A Scheme is statically scoped and properly tail-recursive dialect of the Lisp programming language.
You can read more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)). A Scheme is also a very basic, but robust, programming language that is both simple to use and highly extendible. 

# Usage

You can download the interactive haskell environment from the haskell website: (https://www.haskell.org/downloads/). Then you will be able to run this project through the `ghc` or `ghci`
